# After Effects Audio Visualizer Script

This project is shared as a **tooling and automation example**, highlighting procedural generation
and scripting for creative software rather than a finished end-user product.

A JavaScript (ExtendScript) tool for Adobe After Effects that automatically generates
a complete audio-reactive visualisation setup from a music file.

## What this does
The script creates a new After Effects project and composition, imports an audio file,
and procedurally builds a layered visualisation setup using built-in effects such as
Audio Spectrum, Audio Amplitude, and post-processing effects.

The goal is to eliminate repetitive manual setup and enable rapid iteration on
audio-driven visuals.

## Features
- Project and composition creation via script
- Automatic audio import and layer setup
- Procedural generation of audio-reactive layers
- Centralised controller layer for tuning parameters
- Use of multiple built-in AE effects (Spectrum, Glow, Particles, etc.)

## What this demonstrates
- Tool scripting for creative software
- Procedural content generation
- Automation of complex, multi-step workflows
- Practical JavaScript usage outside web contexts
- Systems thinking applied to creative tooling

## Usage
Run the script via:
**After Effects → File → Scripts → Run Script File…**

The user is prompted to select an audio file and define basic composition settings.

## Notes
This script was developed as part of an academic project and is shared as a code sample.
It is not intended as a finished product, but as a demonstration of scripting and tooling skills.
